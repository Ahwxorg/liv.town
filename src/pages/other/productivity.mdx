<br/>

<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Note-taking</h2>
<br/>

Note-taking is quite important, because you need to set goals and achieve or edit them. My prefered way for a to-do-list is through a long Markdown document, in which I mark the date, and make bullet-points for things that I need to do/have done. I comment out things that are done, so that they turn gray inside Neovim. I heavily prefer this over analog note-taking, since I always tend to lose my notebooks.
<br/>

I also use Markdown for other things like taking notes in class. I type way faster than I can write, and can also have multiple things open, such as slides that the teacher is showing, another document or a Firefox window to quickly look up some more information on what was just said. This helps me a lot because it means that I don't have to look it up later from my own unclear analog notes.
<br/>

I think I will greatly benefit from an e-ink tablet, but those are kind off expensive or pretty garbage, so I'll just wait untill I can get one for cheap/free.

<h2 class="text-xl">Phone</h2>

<br/>
Currently, my main mobile device is a Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, I like it because:
- \* it's small(!)
- \* it has decent-ish battery life (about 3 hours SOT and about 15 hours of standy will drain the battery fully)
- \* has a pretty good DAC (and thus 3.5mm port!)
- \* has USB-C
- \* high speed SoC, which means you're not wasting time staring at a loading screen all that often
- \* 4GB of RAM, so multitasking works fine
- \* unlockable bootloader; runs LineageOS 21 very good
- \* design is very pretty and premium
- \* pretty good front facing speakers
- \* microSD-card slot(!)
- \* is pretty cheap, only about 50 euros used in pretty good state
<br/>

It does have a few downsides:
- \* battery life isn't perfect
- \* slow-ish charging
- \* only 32GB of internal storage, but it does have an SD slot
- \* not easily repairable for the end user
- \* (this is an Android issue, at least for LineageOS without Google Play services) Spotify doesn't like audio playback over the internal speakers
<br/>

I stay productive whilst still carrying around a smartphone by making it very boring. All things that can distract me are tucked away under a few taps, and the things that help me stay productive are a single button. For example: I can open my calendar with a single button, add a new event with another one, but opening Aria, my fediverse client, takes a few swipes and taps. I use the Niagara Launcher, as it has a nice minimal aethetic, whilst still being a bit more functional that Unlauncher (most notably, the calendar feature and music player widget). I also have all notifications turned off, except for calls/calendar events/SMS messages, since those are usually urgent. I try to minimize screen time as much as possible.
<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Tablet</h2>
<br/>

I don't think tablets are great devices for productivity, but since I have a Samsung Galaxy SM-T500 that I got for free, and since I mainly use this tablet to control Spotify and some Home Assistant things. It's basically always either on my desk or next to my bed, to control music or various smart devices. It is okay still on OneUI, but noticible slow and begging for a fresh install of LineageOS, but due to the Spotify problem, I can't use LineageOS yet.

<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Smartwatch</h2>
<br/>

To be fair, it's kind of hard to describe my smartwatch as a productivity tool, but I use a few, and in different ways than most people.
<br/>

I almost only use Pebble's, they're old watches and the company is long gone, but the watches themselves stick kick. I have a Pebble Time Round that I always wear and a Pebble Steel that's backup for when the Pebble Time Round dies. They're are not really smart watches as we know them, and require a little introduction. They're pretty chunky watches (except for the Pebble Time Round), and most have somewhere between 3 and 10 days of battery life (again, except for the Pebble Time Round). They have an E-paper display, which means that they're either monochrome or have limited color support. They don't distract, because they're very limited. For example, I mostly use the one I wear on my wrist for:

<br/>
- \* sleep tracking
- \* step counting
- \* all smartphone notifications that I've enabled (only SMS/calls/calendar)
- \* calendar tracking
- \* timers whenever needed
- \* alarms (for i.e. bed)
<br/>

Since those actions all only take a few clicks, and there's no touchscreen, it does not distract me at all when I'm working. It only distract me, when I get notified of something or a calendar event is telling me to get up and do something else.

<br/>

I also use an original Pebble as a pomodoro timer that's on my desk, as there's a pretty good app for that, and I had a stand still lying around.

<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Computer</h2>
<br/>

I use <span class="underline">[my Framework laptop](https://liv.town/other/configuration)</span> almost always. I only use my desktop whenever I need to do some tasks that are a little hard on the Radeon 760M and require a dedicated GPU.
<br/>

I have the Framework laptop hooked upto a HP Thunderbolt Dock G2 that provides power to it, connects it to my 3 displays and peripherals.
<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Music</h2>
<br/>

I also almost always listen to music when I need to focus. I usually listen to pop, but it really depends on how hard I have to focus. When I have to focus harder, I'll put up some classic game soundtracks, i.e. (I think?) the Final Fantasy VII soundtrack and various music like that, or some chill/jazzy lofi.
<br/>

I use a Marantz receiver with a Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB as an audio source. It allows me to stream Spotify/YouTube (hopefully one day...), as well as connect to it via Bluetooth from my computer. I have speakers all around my room.
<br/>

When I need to focus more, or am in public/not alone, I'll use my earbuds (AirPods Pro 2nd generation) or headphones (Sony WH-CH700N), but the noise cancelling of the AirPods is way better than the Sony headphones, so I'll usually use the AirPods over the Sony headphones.
<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Other non-tech items</h2>
<br/>

I find that chewing gum helps quite a lot when I need to focus, so I have a container of chewing gum on my desk.
<br/>

I also try to keep my desk as clean as possible, put projects that I do in the breaks to the side immediately. Empty desk = empty thoughts
<br/>

I also have my monitors on a stand, since that makes everything a lot less cluttered, and makes the entire desk look more clean.
<br/>

<h2 class="text-xl">Evening or morning?</h2>
<br/>

I'm not really a morning person, but I think it does help that you're a lot more fresh and focussed in the morning. When I need to work in the evening, and I can't focus, I'll sleep for max. an hour and try again after. That usually works wonders.
<br/>

I think the most important thing is that you minimize distractions and temptations, even if that means closing Signal/Element/Discord/whatever. It also really helps to do something with a goal, for example, open Signal to send message x to person y, and do not reply to person z immediately, do that in your breaks.
