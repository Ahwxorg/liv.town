Currently, my main device is a Framework Laptop 13 (sakura)

<br/>

sakura has a Ryzen 5 7640U, 32GB of DDR5 at 5600MHz (Kingston Fury Impact) memory and a 2TB (Crucial P5 Plus) NVMe drive. sakura runs NixOS with full-disk-encryption. I have a setup consisting of Hyprland with most of the software mentioned above. I use nix-shell when I need software without installing it. It's desktop looks like this:
