# Tone indicators

> Tone indicators are usually used to further indicate what the user is trying to say, for example using /j to imply that that body of text should be taken as a joke. The tone of someone's voice can be joking or serious for example, and they can look the same when using text. Tone is an important part of the sentence, and can do a lot to change the meaning and implications of a sentence.

Below is a list of tone indicators that might be helpful to you. In case I missed anything, please [contact me](/contact).
