# Fediverse content warnings

> On the fediverse, content warnings are often used to hide content so that the user can decide if they want to read the content or not. Fediverse users often use abreviations as content warnings, and as there are quite a few, it can be hard to know what they mean.

<br>

Below is a list of often used content warnings that might be helpful to you. In case I missed anything, please [contact me](/contact).
